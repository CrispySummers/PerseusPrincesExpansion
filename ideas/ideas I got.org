#+title: Ideas I Got
I know this about the Perseus Princes: they are an empire in the perseus arm led by several S5 and S4 archai, with one named Prince Vatakesh. They believe in fractalism - the idea that sophontkind is a giant fractal of sophonts from top to bottom. They are also near the Amalgamation.

perhaps fractionalism could even include literal bacteria and viruses? perhaps it encourages clade diversity?

perhaps clade diversity is helped by creating virtual realms free from the constraints of the physical world? and making A-Life? idk
