#+title: Ideas That Discord Came Up With
- here are some ideas that fellow OAUPers came up with on the Discord:
  - perhaps the Perseus Princes are a true  hybrid Muuh, Soft Ones, and Terragen civilization
  - the Perseus Princes could have a top to down chain of beings based on toposophic levels; the S5s could have S4s answering to them, which would have S3s answering to them, all the way down to modosophonts and maybe even sub-sapient beings?
  - @Nyeti proposed that the gothic feel of this empire could be part of its "memetic" appeal: the danger of the Amalgamation, the tight-knit communities, a cabal of princes, and so on.
  - @Nyeti proposed that it could have good and bad sides; good that you are living in an intimate and tight-knit community with clear purpose, bad that the empire is somewhat militaristic compared to most Sephirotics, and there is the danger of the Amalgamation and PADO steralizing systems to avoid Amalgamation infections.
