  - Here is how fractalism might work
    - You have a group of SI:n level minds, they are all slowly merging with an S:n+1 entity, after some time the part that was merged detached and became SI:n again.
      - I think this would work well with fractalism. It would be more in depth than having the SI:n+1 taking care of SI:n, which happens in many ways in the Sephirotics.
      - Perhaps not the entire mind breaks off to return, as it wouldn't stay so smart, but only an allocated portion would break off.
      - This could happen in various ways; in some places physical fusion might be the way to go, while in other places it would merely use a good DNI connection.
